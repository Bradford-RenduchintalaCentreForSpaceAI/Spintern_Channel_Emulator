abstract = {Doppler Applications in LEO Satellite Communication Systems develops and presents an important class of techniques useful in the construction of little Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems. It centers on the very significant Doppler shift that attends communications through a LEO satellite and shows how this phenomenon can be exploited for an unexpected benefit. The techniques taught in the book are expected to be particularly attractive to system engineers because ground-based transceivers must generally compensate for the large Doppler component and therefore the necessary receiver processing loops are often already in place and expensed. This volume starts with a recounting of the characteristics of a LEO satellite and its orbit. The 2nd chapter addresses the LEO orbital geometry and reviews the Doppler effect attending LEO communications. Chapter three is focused on the important task of estimating the Doppler at a ground terminal. Appropriate signal processing algorithms are reviewed. Chapter four is concerned with predicting LEO satellite visibility. Chapters five and six are, respectively, devoted to the use of the significant LEO Doppler as an aid in a new traffic flow control protocol and as an aid for effecting communications power control. The last chapter describes MATLAB based analysis. Doppler Applications in LEO Satellite Communication Systems provides a thorough review of the LEO Doppler phenomenon.}

	abstract = {National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is investigating cognitive technologies for their future communication architecture. These technologies are expected to reduce the operational complexity of the network, increase science data return, and reduce interference to self and others. In order to increase situational awareness, signal classiﬁcation algorithms could be applied to identify users and distinguish sources of interference. As a preliminary step, we seek to develop a system with the ability to discern signals typically encountered in satellite communication. Proposed is an automatic modulation classiﬁer which utilizes higher order statistics (cumulants) and an estimate of the signal-to-noise ratio. These features are extracted from baseband symbols and then processed by a neural network for classiﬁcation. The modulation types considered are phaseshift keying (PSK), amplitude and phase-shift keying (APSK), and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Physical layer properties speciﬁc to the Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite - Second Generation (DVB-S2) standard, such as pilots and variable ring ratios, are also considered. This paper will provide simulation results of a candidate modulation classiﬁer, and performance will be evaluated over a range of signal-to-noise ratios, frequency offsets, and nonlinear ampliﬁer distortions.},

This paper first introduces the multipath fading channel concept of Satellite Communication System. It analyzes the amplitude fading and delay spread for Rayleigh fading and frequency selective fading. Finally, the multi-path fading channel characteristics of Satellite Communication System are simulated and simulated. The results show that multipath fading has a large amplitude fading and delay spread on the signal transmission of Satellite Communication System, resulting in inability to communicate reliably. The simulation results have certain reference value in the channel transmission design of Satellite Communication System.},
