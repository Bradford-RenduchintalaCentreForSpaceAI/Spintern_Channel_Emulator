COMPILING.txt:
Purpose: to provide directives on NeQuick2 P.531 compilation.

NeQuick2 P.531 source code may be compiled with any Fortran 77 compiler in any platform. 

Besides the model itself, there are several test drivers available.
For more information on the model and the drivers, check Readme.txt and folder Documentation.

To run the NeQuick2 create the executable file, by compiling and linking the source files 
NeQuick_2.for and slQu_2.for with a FORTRAN 77 compiler. 
Under a Unix environment, the command has the following format:
	compiler [-o outputfile] NeQuick_2_1.for slQu_2_1.for

For example, to create the neq2 executable file (using the f77 compiler) from the command line type:
	f77 -o neq2 NeQuick_2_1.for slQu_2_1.for

===============================
Makefile

For convenience, a Makefile has been provided for compilation with different standard compilers 
(g77, gcc, f77). 

To select the compiler, change the variable COMMAND in the Makefile. Then change the options 
for such compiler in the file rules_$(COMMAND).make where $(COMMAND) is the reference to the 
compiler (e.g., rules_gcc.make).

The compilation has been succesfully testec in the following platforms:
* gcc/2.95.3, Unix (SunOS 5.8)
* f77 v5.3 from Sun Workshop 6, Unix (SunOS 5.8)
* g77-2.95, Linux (Debian GNU/Linux3.0)
* g77 v0.5.25, Windows XP 

Be aware of data filenames case conventions (ccir**.asc, modip.asc and R12.dat) and also of the 
type of ascii representation (unix, dos, mac) for the line feed/carriage return depending on the platform. 
Conversions may be done with unix2dos, dos2unix commands or with emacs editor 
(directive set-buffer-file-eol-type).
