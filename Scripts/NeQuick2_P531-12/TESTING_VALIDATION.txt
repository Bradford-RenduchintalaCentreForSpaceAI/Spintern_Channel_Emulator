> > Sample test: <  <
===============================
Sample tests for slQu driver are provided in:
	Input: TestingValidation/slQuTests/input_NeQ2.txt
	Output: TestingValidation/slQuTests/output_NeQ2.txt



===============================
> > Validation example: <  <
===============================
Validation input - output files are provided in order to test correct functioning and/or alternative 
implementations of the model. 

Validation test cases are run using the NeQVal driver, together with the 
run_validation_tests.sh script and the reference input datasets.

The validation input reference data is available at TestingValidaton/validation/in/

The validation output reference data is available at TestingValidaton/validation/out_ref/

The run_validation_tests.sh script is written in bash shell scripting language for linux/unix platforms. 
The script calls the NeQVal driver for each of the input data files from the reference input folder.
Equivalent scripts may be written for other platforms.

The run_validation_tests.sh saves the generated data at TestingValidaton/validation/out/
The validation excercise results in those files equal to the output reference files.

The format of the validation data files is provided in TestingValidaton/Validation/README.txt
